# X deals with molar fractions (Y are mass fractions)
# Formating is: <species names>:<mole numbers> (or mass)
# the mole number (or mass) will be automatically converted into molar fractions (or mass)

# The previous method to impose a composition is not flexible.
# An alternative to set the mixture composition:

X = np.zeros(gas.n_species)          # define a vector filled with zeros. The size is the number of species
ich4 = gas.species_index('CH4')      # Identify the index associated to the CH4 species in GRI3.0 mech.
